I am currently working as a Lead Machine Learning Scientist in Binance, world's largest crypto currency exchange by volume. I also work as an advisor to startups and investment firms on deeptech and blockchain technology and advice them on technical due dilligence. 

Why Web3?
------
I got interested in crypto in 2016 after I first learned about Ethereum. Since then I have been buying, selling, reading, and deep-diving into crypto projects. Some of the areas of interest to me in the crypto space are web3 infrastructure companies, decentralised oracles, decentralised search engines, intersection of machine learning and blockchains etc.

Recent
------
Before joining Binance, I was working as an Applied Scientist in the Alexa group within Amazon's Cambridge office. Prior to that I was trying to co-found a company at <a href="https://www.joinef.com">EF</a> for a few months. Previously, I also co-founded an artificial intelligence for scientific discovery company out of Cambridge University's startup accelerator.

I've a PhD in NLP from University College London, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Shawe-Taylor/">John Shawe-Taylor</a>. My PhD research was focussed on information extraction from unstructured text using deep learning, mainly under constraints of scarce training data. I also worked on speeding up convergence, improving generalization, and increasing robustness to adversarial noise, in deep neural networks.
