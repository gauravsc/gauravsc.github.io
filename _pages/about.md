I am currently building the tech needed for ai agents that can learn on the job like humans at <a href="https://versanovatech.com">Versanova</a>. I have previously worked as Scientist / ML Engineer for companies like Amazon, Yahoo and Binance. 


Recent
------
Before joining Binance, I was working as an Applied Scientist in the Alexa group within Amazon's Cambridge office. Prior to that I was trying to co-found a company at <a href="https://www.joinef.com">EF</a> for a few months. 

I've a PhD in NLP from University College London, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Shawe-Taylor/">John Shawe-Taylor</a>. My PhD research was focussed on information extraction from unstructured text using deep learning, mainly under constraints of scarce training data. I also worked on speeding up convergence, improving generalization, and increasing robustness to adversarial noise, in deep neural networks.
