I'm currently working as an applied scientist at amazon. I've a PhD in NLP from <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Shawe-Taylor/">John Shawe-Taylor</a>. My research was focussed on information extraction from unstructured text using deep learning, mainly under constraints of scarce training data. I was also working on speeding up convergence in training deep neural networks, improving generalization, and their robustness to adversarial noise.

I was trying to co-found a company at Entrepeneur First (<a href="https://www.joinef.com">joinef.com</a>) for a few months before joining Amazon as an applied scientist in the Alexa team. Previously, I co-founded an artificial intelligence for scientific discovery company working out of Cambridge University's (JBS) startup accelerator.
