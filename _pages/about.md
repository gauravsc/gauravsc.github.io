I am currently a PhD Candididate in Machine Learning at University College London, United Kingdom. My research is focussed on Information Extraction from unstructured text in general, and biomedical text in particular. I have also done some work in speeding up training of Deep Learning models, with improved generalization, and making them more robust to adversarial noise. 

Recent
------
I spent the last summer working as an NLP Scientist Intern at Amazon, Seattle. There I worked on the problem of Relation Extraction from biomedical text and clinical notes.

Background
------
Before starting PhD, I was an intern at Yahoo! labs, Barcelona. Prior to that I did my MS in Data Mining from University of Pierre and Marie Curie, France, supported by Erasmus Mundus category A scholarship. Before that, I obtained my Undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Delhi College of Engineering, University of Delhi, India.
