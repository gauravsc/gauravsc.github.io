I am currently a <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/G.Singh.html/">PhD Candididate</a> in Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>, United Kingdom. My research is focussed on Information Extraction from unstructured text in general, and biomedical text in particular. I have also done work in speeding up training of <a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11414">deep learning models</a>, with improved generalization, and making them more robust to adversarial noise.

I did my MS in Data Mining at <a href = "http://www.upmc.fr/en/">University of Pierre and Marie Curie</a>, France, supported by erasmus mundus scholarship from Oct-2012 to Sep-2014.
