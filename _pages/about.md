I am currently a PhD Candididate in Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>, United Kingdom. My research is focussed on Information Extraction from unstructured text in general, and biomedical text in particular. I have also done some work in speeding up training of <a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11414">deep learning models</a>, with improved generalization, and making them more robust to adversarial noise. 

Recent
------
I spent the last summer working as an NLP Scientist Intern at <a href ="https://wwww.amazon.com"> Amazon</a>. There I worked on the problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_extraction">Relation Extraction</a> from biomedical text.

Background
------
Before starting PhD, I was an intern at <a href ="https://research.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! labs</a>, Barcelona. Prior to that I did my MS in Data Mining from <a href = "http://www.upmc.fr/en/">University of Pierre and Marie Curie</a>, France, supported by Erasmus Mundus category A scholarship. Before that, I obtained my Undergraduate degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://dtu.ac.in/">Delhi College of Engineering</a>, University of Delhi, India.
