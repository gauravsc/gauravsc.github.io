Currently, I'm working as a scientist for Amazon. Prior to that, I've got a PhD in NLP from University College London, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Shawe-Taylor/">John Shawe-Taylor</a>. In PhD, my research was focussed on information extraction from unstructured text using deep learning, mainly under constraints of scarce training data. Simultaneously, I also worked on speeding up convergence, improving generalization, and increasing robustness to adversarial noise, in deep neural networks.

Before joining amazon, I was trying to co-found a company at <a href="https://www.joinef.com">EF</a> for a few months. In the past, I also co-founded an artificial intelligence for scientific discovery company out of Cambridge University's startup accelerator.
